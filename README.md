# Florals

The Florals Web Application is a secure and dynamic e-commerce platform for a flower shop, built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to browse products, add items to a wishlist or cart using AJAX-powered interactions, and place orders through a secure checkout system. The platform implements user registration and login with hashed passwords, session-based access control, CSRF protection, input validation, and brute-force prevention. For enhanced security, it offers optional two-factor authentication via email OTP or SMS, ensuring verified orders and secure login. Administrators can manage products, including secure image uploads, from a dedicated dashboard. Orders and order items are stored in MySQL, with email notifications sent via PHPMailer. The application emphasizes a seamless, responsive user experience while incorporating modern security practices, making it a scalable and reliable e-commerce solution.
